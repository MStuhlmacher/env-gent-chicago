#(A) NDVI threshold testing:
#1. Import data and libraries
#2. Format the data
#3. Plot % greenspace for each threshold by year (formal vs. informal)
#4. Calculate the smoothness of the trends

# STEP 1 -----------------------------------------------
#Import data and libraries

#Import libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

library(tidyr)
